# Image_Processing_And_Face_Mask_Detection

1. Through Convolution Neural Network, a molde is trained to identify if a person is wearing face mask or not. 
2. The data set we have used here , is preapred by Prajna Bhandary . It consists of 1376 images which belong to two classes - with mask and without mask. 
3. Additionaly , we have wrote two different python file to plot the accuracy and loss for training and validation.
4. In the TrainedModel folder , all the modes which trained using different parameters , their traing and validation accuracy in each poch and accuracy and loss plots are stored.
