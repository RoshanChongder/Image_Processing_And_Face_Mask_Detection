# Image_Processing_And_Face_Mask_Detection_Using_Convolution_Neural_Network

1. Through Convolution Neural Network, a model is trained to identify if a person is wearing face mask or not. 
2. The dataset we have used here , is prepared by Prajna Bhandary . It consists of 1376 images which belong to two classes - with and without the mask. 
3. Additionally , we have written two different python file to plot the accuracy and loss for training and validation.
4. In the TrainedModel folder , all the models ( which are trained using different parameters ) , their weights ,  training and validation accuracy in each epoch and accuracy and loss plots are stored.   
5. The plot folder consist of the two python files named acc.py and loss.py , which are used to plot the graphical representation of accuracy and loss plot in each epoch while training the model.
