# Image_Processing_And_Face_Mask_Detection_Using_Convolution_Neural_Network

1. Through Convolution Neural Network, a molde is trained to identify if a person is wearing face mask or not. 
2. The data set we have used here , is preapred by Prajna Bhandary . It consists of 1376 images which belong to two classes - with mask and without mask. 
3. Additionaly , we have wrote two different python file to plot the accuracy and loss for training and validation.
4. In the TrainedModel folder , all the modes which trained using different parameters , their traing and validation accuracy in each poch and accuracy and loss plots are stored.   
5. The plot folder consist of the two python files named acc.py and loss.py whicha are used to plot the graphical representation of accuracy and loss plot in each epoch while training the moldel.
