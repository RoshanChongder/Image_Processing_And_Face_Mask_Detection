# Image_Processing_And_Face_Mask_Detection
Through Convolution Neural Network, a molde is trained to identify if a person is wearing face mask or not. Here , we have built the convolution neural network by adding different layers to it.
The data set we have used here , is preapred by Prajna Bhandary . It consists of 1376 images which belong to two classes - with mask and without mask. 
Additionaly , we have wrote two different python file to plot the accuracy and loss for training and validation.
